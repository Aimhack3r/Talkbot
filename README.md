# Talkbot
Talkbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. 
How a Chatbot Works
There are two different tasks at the core of a chatbot:

User request analysis
Returning the response

User Request Analysis
This is the first task that a chatbot performs. It analyzes the user’s request to identify the user intent and to extract relevant entities.

Returning the Response
Once the user’s intent has been identified, the chatbot must provide the most appropriate response for the user’s request. The answer may be:

a generic and predefined text;
a text retrieved from a knowledge base that contains different answers;
a contextualized piece of information based on data the user has provided;
data stored in enterprise systems;
the result of an action that the chatbot performed by interacting with one or more backend application; or,
a disambiguating question that helps the chatbot to correctly understand the user’s request.
